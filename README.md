🚀 Data Analytics Project – Drugs, Side Effects & Medical Conditions
 📍 Internship at Unified Mentor
 🛠 Tool Used: Microsoft Excel
During my internship at Unified Mentor, I worked on a real-world healthcare dataset containing detailed information on drugs, medical conditions, side effects, pregnancy categories, and more.
🔍 Key Steps & Insights:
Cleaned data by removing blanks & duplicates, structured it into tables.
Created Pivot Tables to analyze trends and answer questions like:
Top 5 most reviewed drugs & Top 10 highest-rated drugs
Most frequent medical conditions & side effects
Drug distribution by pregnancy category & CSA type
Ratings by prescription type (Rx/OTC) and alcohol interaction
Designed an interactive dashboard with:
Visuals: bar charts, pie charts, histograms, line charts
Cards: Total reviews, Average rating, Most reviewed drug, Most frequent condition
Slicers for quick filtering by drug name, pregnancy category, CSA, and condition
✅ This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, pivot table analysis, dashboard design, and storytelling with data, helping transform raw medical data into meaningful insights.
